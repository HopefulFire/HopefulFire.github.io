I have loved coding for a long time. From a young age, my father has always been a huge nerd, using linux and coding projects since I can remember. The first program I remember him making was a game involving me and my brother, which was inspired by us. I can remember being irritated about my father "stealing my ideas". Little did I know that was half the brilliance.

My dad introduced me to a programming language at a young age. It was a "game" called Scratch, and I loved it. I made a maze program: it was such endless fun. Ever since I have been inspired by the idea of creating with my own hands new life in the machines, telling them what to do and how to do it. I had such aspirations; I wanted to breathe life into the computer.

I have always been a difficult student to teach, I think, since I always learned what I wanted to rather than what my parents wanted me to. I was homeschooled, in fact, and they taught me physics, geography, how to read and write, and, of course, the dreaded fractions. I would read college books, trying to learn everything I possibly could, despite not understanding a word.

Then, of course, there was tragedy. But who doesn't have tragedy?

I have been changed by my experiences since. I am no longer that young boy who wanted to know everything, who wanted to be a jack of all trades. But I am something else now; I hope I am stronger than I was.

The first thing that brought me back was machine learning.

I had always thought it ought to be possible to teach a computer to learn by itself, and the technology to do so was now unfolding before my eyes! It was amazing to read article after article of breakthroughs and advances. I began watching YouTube videos on machine learning and tried to make my own text recognition software, and... ultimately failed.

But over past few years I have slowly become obsessed with bringing meaning into my life through programming. I have taught myself first procedural Python, coding a program to automatically play minesweeper with what I had learned. I cursed object oriented programming, because I couldn't understand it. Then I started using Github, learned object oriented Python, and made a simple minesweeper cli with my knowledge.

If I have learned anything, it's that I don't know a lot more than I know. But I've learned what it means to exist, to be alive, and for me that is to code.

And I will follow my father's footsteps, one step at a time.
