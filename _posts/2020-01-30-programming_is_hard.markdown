One lesson I'm learning as I work at Flatiron is that sometimes you just have to accept that you don't know all the answers. I have had to use the Ask a Question help desk several times, despite my best efforts. Learning at Flatiron for me has been quite a humbling experience as I tackle the task of becoming a software developer.

Many concepts, such as `has many` and `belongs to`, were difficult for me to begin with. I learned some object oriented programming in Python beforehand, so I thought it was going to be a breeze for me. It turns out, I had no idea how many little gears are in place in the mind of an object oriented programmer!

Before Flatiron, I would have had no idea how to make a `Book` class that has instances of itself that `belong to` `Author` instances, who each `have many` books. Modeling real world objects in a programmatic way is a very useful skill that allows us to make more complicated programs faster.

Before Flatiron, I did not like object oriented programming, and I must admit I actually hated it. I had no idea what I was talking about, but I thought that it was useless and overly complicated. Now that I have learned some OOP, I am glad to say that my opinion on that has changed.

Before Flatiron, I had no real useful skills to offer a development team trying to build a web application, but now I know how to scrape, create objects from that data, and have my objects collaborate in a useful way. I know how to use and create modules. I will learn how to build a proper CLI that puts all of my skills to the test.

Flatiron has been a blessing to me, and I am excited to learn more.

But I will always keep in mind that programming, whatever it is, is difficult, and I need to give myself the benefit of time. Time to struggle and complete labs, one by one. Time to develop professional relationships with my colleagues. Time to learn to code. And to anyone else reading this, best of luck in your career!
