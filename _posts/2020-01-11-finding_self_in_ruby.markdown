I started out programming in Python, and in Python, `self` is an added on sort of concept. Instead of `self` always existing no matter where you were, `self` is passed in as an argument to the function. Ruby's `self` is a change in philosophy that suits its object-oriented focus.

After all, in the real world, when are we separate from our `self`? Einstien's theory of relativity implies that everything is dependent on the observer, or the location and energy of the `self`. We are never separate from our personal experience. At any moment I can draw on my experiences relative to my `self`, perform actions dependent on my `self`, and change my `self`. Doesn't it make sense for `self` to be implicit?

In many ways, programming is a journey of `self`-discovery. I am learning who I am, not just as a programmer, but as a person, too. I am not ready to struggle through the hard problems that "real" programmers face. I have not developed my own signiture coding style. I have not joined a dev team, or started my first real project. But I say, I will!
