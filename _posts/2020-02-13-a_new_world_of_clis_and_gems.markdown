My CLI Data Gem Portfolio project was a difficult journey for me. It felt like I had to learn ten different things at once, then cram all of my knowledge into one space! However, I think I learned while doing the project, and I am glad to say I have completed it to my satisfaction.

While working on this project, I had a few pitfalls. First, even getting my gem to work at all took several days. Then, I realized the website I was trying to scrape wasn't going to work. I had to nearly completely restart, rewriting large chunks of my code. Also, I got stuck in the final bit, once I had finished writing all of the object oriented stuff and the scraper. I just needed to write a CLI, but I had no idea where to start. Since I had been following test driven development through the whole process, I was just staring at my tests, wondering what to do next. It turns out I just needed to ignore my rspec tests and focus on creating an executable for my program. Working though these problems taught me how to better think like a developer.

While I was researching the stuff I needed to know to create a gem, I had to do some hard research on my own. I found that Avi's videos, while helpful, were not sufficient for me. I found a video online that was very helpful and described how to create a gem. While I was doing that, I also wanted to learn test driven development. Avi I found was a very useful guide on how to properly write tests, and after a few struggles I managed to create my first tests. The tests helped me speed through the object oriented portion of the project. They allowed me, as Avi put it, to describe what I want to exist, rather than worry about the syntax and implementation. All in all, creating this gem taught me a lot about how to gather knowledge about a subject in a short period of time, and turn that knowledge into something useful.

I learned a lot during this time period. I was able to help a fellow student out with my knowledge, and this helped me gather confidence in my abilities as a programmer. I learned that I am fairly decent at reading and interpreting errors through lots of practice. I pick up new ideas faster than I thought. Hey, I might even be decent at writing blog posts, who knew? Positive thinking is an incredibly powerful tool and difficult skill to learn.

I did not just grow as a programmer. I grew as a person. I am glad to thank Flatiron for helping me when I needed it, letting me struggle when appropriate, and all the resources provided by kind people online! I am excited to see what is next in my journey as a software engineer.
